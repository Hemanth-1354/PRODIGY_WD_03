# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**, a simple, interactive web-based version of the classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Player Selection**: Choose whether Player 1 plays as X or O.
- **Turn Indicator**: Visual indication of the current player's turn.
- **Score Tracking**: Track the number of wins for both players and the number of ties.
- **Restart and Quit Options**: Ability to restart the game or quit and reset scores.
- **Next Round**: Continue playing rounds without losing track of scores.
- **Game Logic**: Automatic detection of winning combinations and ties.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the game.

- **JavaScript**: Game logic, dynamic UI updates, and interaction handling.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Side**: Pick whether Player 1 will be X or O.
2. **Start Playing**: Players take turns by clicking on an empty cell in the game grid.
3. **Winning**: The first player to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the round.
4. **Tie**: If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
5. **Restart**: You can restart the game at any point by clicking the restart button.
